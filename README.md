# NLP_PracticesForDeepLearning
The purpose of this project is simply sharing my practice on NLP techniques in Deep Learning. 
Most of the practice exercises came from the book "Deep Learning for Natural Language PRocessing: Solve your NLP problems with Deep Neural Networks"
by Karthiek Reddy Bokka, Shubhangi Hora, Tanuj Jain and Monica Wambugu.
