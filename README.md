# NLP_PracticesForDeepLearning
The purpose of this project is simply sharing my practice on NLP techniques in Deep Learning. 
Most of the practice exercises came from the book "**Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing**: Solve your NLP problems with Deep Neural Networks"
by *Karthiek Reddy Bokka, Shubhangi Hora, Tanuj Jain and Monica Wambugu.*

The PIP Packages Version for my python code practice is described in Requirements.txt
