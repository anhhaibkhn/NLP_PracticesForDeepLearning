I note that articles about other sitting Justices have been similarly \"\"enhanced;\"\" and I also believe those changes are no improvement. \n \n In support of my view that this edit should be reverted, I would invite anyone to re-visit articles written about the following pairs of jurists.\n  A1. Benjamin Cardozo\n  A2. Learned Hand\n \n  B1. John Marshall Harlan\n  B2. John Marshall Harlan II\n \n The question becomes: Would the current version of the Wikipedia article about any one of them or either pair be improved by academic credentials in the introductory paragraph? I think not.\n \n Perhaps it helps to repeat a wry argument Kathleen Sullivan of Stanford Law makes when she suggests that some on the Harvard Law faculty wonder how Antonin Scalia avoided learning what others have managed to grasp about the processes of judging? I would hope this anecdote gently illustrates the point. \n \n Less humorous, but an even stronger argument is the one Clarence Thomas makes when he mentions wanting to return his law degree to Yale.\n \n At a minimum, I'm questioning this edit? It deserves to be reconsidered. \"\nBye! \n \n Don't look, come or think of comming back! Tosser.\nHow could I post before the block expires?

Unfortunately, my attempts failed - I'm still effectively the only one who does it. The classical music wikiproject was not interested, (Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Classical_music/Archive_5#Need_help.21Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Music/Archive_3#I_could_use_some_helpWikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Music/Archive_2#Raulbot.2C_and_the_music_list) So I really had given up trying to interest others. \n The sound list was featured on digg a while back - http://digg.com/music/Wikipedia_has_free_classical_music_downloads .

I never claimed O'Donohue had that position, rather that practitioners and researchers in the field ignored the DSM position, which is exactly what the quote says and also something O'Donohue agrees with. \n \n Again, I was combating the notion that it was a \"\"absurd part\"\" to claim that pedophilia is a sexual orientation. Since many researchers hold this position, it would be unfair to call it absurd. The disorder part is divided in the field, some argue that it is not a disorder at all, some do. At the end of the day, it is a value judgment (as Cantor pointed out earlier in the thread), not a scientific judgement. If we choose to make this value judgment in the article, it should be stated clearly and not pretend to have a scientific basis. \"\nYour blatant POV pushing \n \n Neither of you guys has made any contribution to this Italian history article other than to shove your unhistorical unconstructive modern POV in my face.\n This is a HISTORY article.

It would benefit greatly from the introduction of additional information about the negative aspects of the T-34. Just for the record, this sort of balance problem is not uncommon when there is an over dependence on the works of a particular author. For example, testing and evaluation of a T-34 by the US Army Ordnance Dept. exposed some very serious problems with the tank. This type of information should be included in the article to bring it back into balance.\nSorry about that. I had checked, but had only come up with Dulas Bay.

LOL, the [[Reformist Party (Serbia)|Reformist Party] is having another go (the 20th very last on the parliamentary election, winning less votes than notable to actually be mentioned). ) \n By the way, here's something very little people have figured out - the new Constitution of Serbia has been brought to enable Kosovo' secession. The 1990 Constitution barred that as a possibility, and after the Kumanovo Military-Technical Agreement was signed between NATO and FRY the SRS broke its coalition with SPS and the government collapsed, causing new elections - because that was unconstitutional, as an act of highest treason, enough to be tried from maximum sentence (which the Radicals demanded from then to his death, to have a trial in Serbia, and to be tried for treason among other reasons). This constitution releases the authorities from that weight, and they won't have to go to prison if they recognize any form of further loss of sovereignty in Kosovo. ;) 15\nNew WikiProject Novels initiative\n We have begun a new initiative at the WikiProject Novels: an improvement drive.

Your input to Culture of Lithuania is welcomed. \n Some problems of defining personalities or attributing them to certain well-known ideological systems may raise here. I propose a quite liberal variant of it, where definition may not be connected with one certain word. Necessity however to follow certain classifying remains. \n \n My initial ideas on this branch, the ones, concerning period of Lithuanian national Renaissance period: Some artists, writers or other cultural workers of this period are often described as modernists. This definition is not false, but some more concrete things should be added, some specifics of Lithuania. \n We should distinguish leading ideas of the Nat. Renaissance from later modernism, which is more known for us. Cultural aspirations of the later Nat. Ren. may be defined as modernism in a cultural context of Lithuania. But they accented also expression of Lithuanian cultural heritage, and their expression may be seen as something simply typically Lithuanian. I mean, that such authors in as Ã„Å’iurlionis is seen as modernist in Lithuanian context, but it also (and even more) is a representative of Lithuanian culture, when in European or World-wide context. A parallel example may be taken from literature of India. Poet Tagore, well known Nobel price winner is known for us as a representative of culture of India. Making India more understandable and closer for western people is concerned as main his input to Western culture. But in his own country, he was seen as a modernist too, who was changing traditional cultural forms, especially stagnated ones. This way also Lithuanian cultural leaders of the N. Ren. could be seen as modernists, which were broadening cultural forms and changing stagnated ones, in Lithuanian context. They also can be seen as modernists in a wider context, but more for acquainting Western people with Lithuanian culture than for their direct input into Western culture. Ã„Å’iurlionis is the best example here. \n In other way, the later Lithuanian modernists (they depended mostly to later generation, approximately from 4th decade of the 20th century) concerned themselves part of Western modernistic movement and their main purpose (looking generally) was to introduce Western European ideas into Lithuanian cultural life (see the table below). \n We see two different movements and two different world outlooks here. The problem is, that both movements collaborated, especially their political wings did, and interchange of ideas between them is well seen. So, many researchers don't pay attention to this difference. Especially in the Soviet period, when national ideas were officially forbidden, mixture in description of these movements was allowed. E. g. philosopher RamÃ…Â«nas Bytautas, who clearly depends to the first generation, is often described as liberal. And it may be understood in a sense of the second generation (as idea of liberalism).\n  \n \n  period and generation artists, writers, philosophers etc in a context of Lithuania in an European context The National Renaissance period, the younger generation, approx 1905 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1930 painter and composer Ã„Å’iurlionis, painter Kazys Ã… imonis, poet and philosopher Vilius Storastas - VydÃ…Â«nas, dramatist Sofija KymantaitÃ„â€” - Ã„Å’iurlionienÃ„â€”, poets Adomas JakÃ…Â¡tas, Motiejus Gustaitis, Liudas Gira, composer Stasys Ã… imkus, philosopher RamÃ…Â«nas Bytautas. reformers and innovators of Lithuanian culture Representatives of Lithuanian culture, almost unknown before them.

He's one whose recent research has focused primarily on the social aspects of climate change and is thus at least as qualified to comment on the state of consensus as a historian. Regarding his study, it hasn't been published in a peer-reviewed journal, but the results have appeared in many reliable sources. In effect, it should be treated no differently than as if Peiser himself (or any other scientist) had verbally relayed the conclusions directly to a reporter. Literally tens of thousands of Wiki articles contain such references direct quotes from scientists, which appear in no other source but through the medium of a reputable reporter.\n"
